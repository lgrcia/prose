3.0.0:
- save image as hdf5 with associated products
- keep Observation?
- Make full use of photutils.segmentation instead of skimage
- Documentation make clearer argument type (like `~numpy.array`)
- A clear documentation on image axes and angle orientation (like source.coord or source.orientation). Indeed this differs from numpy convention opposite from the way we usually deal with geometric points
- use astropy lazy property 

2.3.1:
- put into dev branch
- Turn all cutouts to prose.cutouts.Cutouts objects which must include:
    - cutout fitting
    - profile from cutout (almost done, test for single stars on small cutout)
    - profile and fitting plots
- check dependencies, remove unused
- used newly created sources aperture to rewrite the aperture photometry (and annulus) Blocks
? try photutils segmented detection, compare against skimage
? check difference between using Background2D and BackgroundAnnulus

2.3.0:
- merge
- publish
